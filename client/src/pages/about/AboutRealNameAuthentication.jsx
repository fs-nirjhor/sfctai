        Why Real Name Authentication is required?
      </h1>
      <p className="bg-mySecondary p-3 rounded-md">
        The real name authentication system is in place to protect your funds
        and company ID. Your ID will be successfully verified within moments of
        submission with your NID card, passport, driving license for real name
        authentication. By doing real name authentication you can bring your ID
        into the protection say through which you can be sure about your funds.
        If a person withdraws money after real name authentication, the funds
        must be withdrawn with a live selfie. In this process if any person
        hacks your account then the company will protect you because after real
        name authentication if any bad person or bad guy or hacker wants to
        withdraw your funds with NID card, passport, driving license. The
        company will fail to withdraw the money unless the ID is verified by
        real name authentication without any live selfie. A malicious person or
        someone who submits a selfie through artificial intelligence or editing
        will fail its withdrawal. If this process is done more than once but
        also if the original owner does not take any measures to protect his ID.
        Then aftaai company will be obliged to ban that ID. Thank you.
