        Why Real Name Authentication is required?
      </h1>
      <p className="bg-mySecondary p-3 rounded-md">
        The reason for implementing the real name authentication system is to
        protect your aftaai id and protect your funds. The company has
        introduced real name authentication system to protect your ID from being
        hacked by many fake people and bad people around you in the crypto
        currency market.Later if the person withdraws money with his own live
        selfie then the company will successfully withdraw money to his digital
        wallet. Special warning that after submission of person&apos;s NID card,
        withdrawal will be rejected if someone else withdraws his/her picture or
        his/her picture from that account through artificial intelligence and
        editing. And if this process continues multiple times, the original
        owner does not make any preparations to protect his account. Thank you
      </p>
